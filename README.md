# Decentralized Insurance Claims Processing

A blockchain-based platform for transparent, efficient, and automated insurance claims management.

## Overview

This decentralized system transforms traditional insurance claims processing by leveraging blockchain technology to create immutable records of policies and claims while automating verification and payment procedures. Our platform reduces fraud, accelerates settlements, minimizes disputes, and enhances trust between insurers and policyholders through transparent, rule-based claims handling.

## Core Components

### Policy Management Contract
- Records insurance terms and coverage details as smart contracts
- Creates immutable digital representations of policy documents
- Implements automated premium calculations and payment tracking
- Manages policy updates, amendments, and renewal processes
- Provides cryptographic proof of coverage effective dates and terms

### Claim Submission Contract
- Handles secure documentation of insured events with timestamp verification
- Implements structured data collection for different claim types
- Securely stores supporting evidence including photos, reports, and statements
- Creates tamper-proof audit trails of all submission activities
- Enables real-time status tracking for policyholders

### Verification Contract
- Validates claim details against policy terms through automated rule execution
- Integrates with oracle services for external data verification
- Implements fraud detection algorithms and anomaly identification
- Manages adjuster reviews and approvals with immutable record-keeping
- Creates comprehensive verification histories for compliance and audit purposes

### Payment Processing Contract
- Manages efficient disbursement of approved claims
- Implements programmable payment logic based on claim type and coverage
- Creates verifiable records of all payment transactions
- Handles complex settlement scenarios including partial payments and deductibles
- Provides instant notification and confirmation of completed settlements
